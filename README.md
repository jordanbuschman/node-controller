# node-controller

This program is the server for my collaborative music queueing app. It is built with node.js, and uses SocketIO to receive and send messages. It works on all Unix systems.

## Installing
Make sure you have node.js installed, then go to terminal, and type:

```
git pull https://github.com/jordanbuschman/node-controller.git
cd node-controller
sudo npm install
node start
```
